Made an Tic-Tac-Toe game, a classic two-player game designed to be played on a single screen. In this game, players take turns to make their moves, with one player choosing their move first, followed by the second player. The objective is to align three of their respective symbols, either "X" or "O," in a row, column, or diagonal to win the game. The game board is a 3x3 grid where each player strategically places their symbol to outwit their opponent and achieve the winning alignment. This project highlights fundamental game development concepts and provides an engaging way to practice strategic thinking and user interface design.
